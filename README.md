# React Weather App

This is the second in a series of little learning projects to improve my knowledge and experience with React and Svelte.

## Guidelines

The project follows the following guidelines:

1. Features first, specs second, tests third, tools fourth, implementation fifth, beauty last. 
    1. We write Features and wireframes to create a vision of the project
    0. Then we write specs to describe components, events and states.
    0. Then we write tests before we write implementation code, 
    0. Then we write basic code to satisfy our tests, 
    0. Then we introduce tools, packages and helpers to improve code and functionality without breaking the tests,
    0. Then we format and beautify the project -- ___after___ we know for sure that everything works.

2. We care about our vision and our features, not about our tools. Tools and frameworks help us to implement features in a better way. That's the only value they have.

3. Simplicity rules. We want to be proud about our ideas, our vision, our features, our results, not about the fancy code we write. Simplicity means efficiency, maintainability, it makes the project manageable and makes errors and bugs less likely.

4. We are transparent. We document our decisions, our planning, our successes, our struggles, our errors and the lessons we learned from our experience. This will make us grow.
