Finished the following Todo items:

- [x] ~~Build a tmux environment for the project~~
- [x] ~~Install the Poppins font~~
- [x] ~~Install the Bulma Framework~~

The hardest struggle was installing the Poppins font into the project. The following code did the trick:

```scss
// file: /src/main.scss

// Import fontsource font installed as npm/yarn package
// See https://fontsource.org/ for details
@import "@fontsource/poppins/index.css";
```

Installed the project and pushed it to Github. Nothing installed or implemented yet.
